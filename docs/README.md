# Introduction
[![build images](https://github.com/BackendStack21/restana-static/actions/workflows/build_images.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BackendStack21/restana-static/actions/workflows/build_images.yaml)

Efficiently serve static files using Node.js and Docker containers: https://itnext.io/restana-static-serving-the-frontend-with-node-js-beyond-nginx-e45fdb2e49cb

Example Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM kyberneees/restana-static:latest
RUN rm dist/index.html
RUN echo "Hello World!" >> dist/index.html
```

# Configuration options
The HTTP server and runtime configuration can be managed using the https://www.npmjs.com/package/config module. The `/restana-static/config` directory should be populated/overwritten during image creation. 

## Default configuration: 
```json
{
    "port": 3000,
    "cacheEnabled": true, 
    "cacheControlHeaderValue": "public, no-cache, max-age=604800",
    "distDirectory": "dist/",
    "defaultFile": "index.html",
    "logsEnabled": true, 
    "logsFormat": "tiny"
}
```
> File location : `/restana-static/config/default.json`

## Environment based configuration
Optionally, you can overwrite each configuration entry using corresponding environment variables.
```bash
# port
PORT 
# cacheEnabled
CACHE_ENABLED
# cacheControlHeaderValue
CACHE_CONTROL_HEADER_VALUE
# distDirectory
DIST_DIRECTORY
# defaultFile
DEFAULT_FILE
# logsEnabled
LOGS_ENABLED
# logsFormat
LOGS_FORMAT
```

# Adding static files
The `/restana-static/dist` directory should be populated/overwritten during image creation. 
> Please consider that default files path will change if you overwrite the `distDirectory` config.

# Log formats
Logs are provided by the module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan  

Allowed `logsFormat` values are described at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan#predefined-formats

# Cache support
Caching is provided by the module: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-cache-middleware

# Custom middlewares
You can also introduce other features such as authentication, security protections, etc... by using custom middlewares.  
You can just replace the `middlewares.js` file by your own configuration.  

Default:
```js 
// custom middlewares set
// this file is intended to be overwritten by final images
const helmet = require('helmet')

module.exports = [
  helmet
]
```
> Please note that the `helmet` middleware enabled by default. See more details here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet
